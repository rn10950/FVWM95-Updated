This is the version 0.7.5 of xcpaint, a paint program for xclass. The code
is based on the Xt Pixmap program.

Current bugs and features:

- Handles only XPM files, with support for transparent pixels.

- Color palettes cannot be loaded/edited/saved yet, so if you want to have
  colors, you'll have first to load a file containing many colors ;-).

- Color selection is very primitive at this stage.

- Edit/Undo is not working properly yet.

You need to have xclass (version 0.8.3 or higher) installed in order to
build it. The compilation is simple, just a 'make'.

Enjoy!
Hector.
