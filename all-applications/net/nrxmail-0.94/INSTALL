This program requires the Xclass toolkit. I personally suggest that u have
installed version 0.9.2 or newer.

- Untar the package whereever you want. 
  The result will be a subdir containing the source and icons of NRX Mail.

- Switch into this directory and simply type "make".
  After that u will (hopefully) find the binary inside this dir.
  Copy it into a directory which is inside the PATH variable (containing all
  dirs where executables are located).

- Copy "xpm/nrxmail.s.xpm" and "xpm/nrxmail.t.xpm" into the xclass icon
  directory (e.g. to /usr/local/xclass/icons)
  
- If you use fvwm95 and the pixmap path of it points to the xclass icon dir
  add following line to your ~/.fvwm95rc file:

  Style "NRX Mail"     TitleIcon nrxmail.t.xpm

  (if the xclass icon dir isn't in the pixmap path, change that or copy
  nrxmail.t.xpm into one of the pixmaps dir)

- To start NRX Mail, type "nrxmail".
  If it's your first time (first love (:) the preferences dialog will pop
  up with some guessed values for you and your system.   
  Adjust them as necessary and click "ok".
  Now you are ready to read and compose mails !
