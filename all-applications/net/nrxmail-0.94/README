Release notes:
--------------

This is the first official "release" of NRX Mail. Right now it is only a
development snapshot, so no final release, nor beta not even alpha!!!
Besides the normal "no warranty" warning, this is a "Beware, pre-alpha
stuff" warning.

To all those, who ran the cvs version: 

  The "Outbox" folder moved to "Unsent", so

1) delete the ~/.nrxmail folder, or
2) rename "Outbox" to "Unsent" and change the nrxmail.ini file apropriate


Introduction:
-------------

NRX Mail is just another mail client for X. It uses the Xclass toolkit,
for more information on Xclass, see:

	http://xclass.sourceforge.net/

Furthermore it is part of the fOX Project, fOX home is:

	http://www.foxproject.org

The final version of this program will provide all necessary features you
would expect from a mail client. To get an overview of the current
features/missing stuff, have a look at the TODO file.


Installation:
-------------

See the INSTALL file for instructions about how to install NRX Mail


Usage:
------

After starting the program you will see several items:

- the menu bar:
  All actions dealing with individual mail messages and folders can be
  selected via the menu.

- the toolbar:
  Here you will find some shortcuts for features find in the menu bar.
  If you are unsure about the action of a particular button, just move the
  pointer over the pointer and wait a short time.
  A tip window with a short explanation will appear.

- the header window:
  All mail messages of a folder are displayed in this window with state,
  date, origin and subject.
  By clicking at one header line, you will see the contents of the
  particular message

- the message window:
  Shows the contents of the currently selected mail message.

- attachments frame:
  If you selected a mail message containing attachments (files which where
  send with the mail) a button is shown which will open the attachments
  frame. Every attached file will be represented by an icon, depending on
  the type of file (as defined in your .mime.types file).
  If the document type is known, you will see the corresponding icon.
  By double clicking on such an icon, the apropriate application will be
  launched, dispaying the file contents.
  By clicking at the icon with the right mouse button, you can select
  between viewing the file contents or save the file to disc.
  Attachments of unknown file type can only be saved.

- status bar:
  Displays the number of message of the current folder.


Folders:
--------

A folder contains several mail messages.
NRX Mail creates four folders which are essential for using it.
These folders are:

- Inbox:
  New mail messages are stored in this folder

- Unsent:
  When composing a mail message you can select wether to send it at once or
  send it later.
  If you choose the latter, the composed message will be stored at this folder.
  You can send all mail messages inside this folder at any time by selecting
  "Send Unsent Messages" from the "File" menu.

- Sentmail:
  A copy of every sent mail message is stored inside this folder.

- Trash:
  If you delete a mail message, it will not be deleted immediately, but
  instead will be stored in this folder.
  This way you can ban it from the origin folder without loosing it.
  To remove deleted messages, select "File" -> "Empty Trash" or switch
  to folder Trash and select "Folder" -> "Clear Folder"

These four folders are called "System Folders". System folders can't be
deleted nor renamed.

Of course you can create your own folders to store mail messages wich are
related to each other by any mean. These folders are "User Folders". You can
rename and delete them.

When deleting a folder, all the messages on it are immediately erased, and
not moved to the Trash folder!!! Clearing a folder (execpt "Trash") will
move all mail messages from this folder to folder "Trash".

Besides system and user folders, there are two more folder attributes:
"Linked Folder" and "Regular Folder".

- Regular Folder:
  Well, normal folder, a file inside ~/.nrxmail

- Linked Folder:
  A link inside ~/.nrxmail pointing to a regular folder somewhere in your
  disk. The idea is to be able to access folders created by other mail
  clients without duplicating them.

Both System folders and User folders can be either linked or regular.

Deleting a regular folder will cause the particular file inside ~/.nrxmail
to be deleted. When deleting a linked folder, a dialog box will pop up
which lets you select wether you want to:
 
 - delete only the link in ~/.nrxmail
 - delete also the linked folder


Incoming Mails:
---------------

Incoming mail messages are stored at the Inbox folder.
Messages can be deleted (moved to folder "Trash") and moved between folders.
You can reply to any mail messages or forward them to other ppl.
All those actions can be selected via the "Message" menu.
Finally you can have a look at the message source itself.
Besides the information of the message header window and the message itself,
you can see additional information added by all mail delivery system the
message passed from it's origin up to your Inbox folder.

To check for the new mail which might have arrived while you are running NRX
Mail, select "File"->"Check Mail".


Composing Mail:
---------------

To compose a message, select "File"->"Compose".
A new window will appear which is divided into three parts:

- Adresses:
  Here you can enter recipient adresses and those which
  should get a copy.
  Furthermore you specify the subject of your message

- Message:
  Enter the message text

- Attachments:
  Here you can attach files to your mail message.


You can send a message right after composing it or, e.g.
you have no permanent Internet connect, send it later.
In this case the message is stored in folder "Unsent".
You can send unsent messages at any time you want (and
have a connect).
