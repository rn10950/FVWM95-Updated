<H1>Scanning</H1>

The scan window provides the operator with the ability to quickly scan
the radio bands and produce a visual representation of station activity.

<b>Scan start and stop</b><p>

Use the <b>Start</b> button to begin the scan. During scan, the receiver is
tuned sequentially to each frequency in the selected range and the signal
strength is recorded. The band scope is updated as each data point is
acquired. When the scan is complete, the old tuning frequency is restored
and the receiver will return to normal operation.<p>

The scan is performed with the current <a href="controls.html#AGC">AGC</a>
and <a href="controls.html#filters">filter</a> settings. The frequency the
receiver is tuned to is used as the center frequency for the sweep.<p>

To stop a scan in progress at any time, use the <b>Stop</b> button.<p>

To mute the receiver during the scan operation, use the <b><a
href="controls.html#mute">Mute</a></b> button in the main window.<p>

<a name="range"></a>
<b>Scan range</b><p>

Use the <b>Range</b> buttons to select the desired sweep width. The
current selection is displayed at the bottom right corner of the band
scope display.<p>

If the range is changed while a scan is in progress, the scan will be
restarted.<p>

<a name="scale"></a>
<b>Scale mode</b><p>

Use the <b>Scale</b> buttons to select between linear (Lin) or logarithmic
(Log) scales.<p>

<ul> 
<li>When using the <i>linear</i> scale, the vertical axis is numbered from 0
to 1. A signal that reaches 0.5 on the vertical scale is twice as strong as
a signal that reaches 0.25.<p>
<li>The <i>logarithmic</i> scale allows a greater range of signal levels to
be represented. In this mode the vertcal scale is marked in decibels (dB). 
A signal that is twice as strong as another will appear as 6 dB <i>higher</i>.
</ul>

The selection between Lin and Log can be done at any moment, without having
to stop or restart the scan.<p>

<a name="style"></a>
<b>Display style</b><p>

Sample points in the band scope window may be displayed either as a
continuous single line or as bar histogram. To choose between these, use the
<b>Style</b> buttons.<p>

The selection between Line and Bars can be done at any moment, without
having to stop or restart the scan.<p>

<a name="cursors"></a>
<b>Cursor lines</b><p>

Two cursors can appear in the graphic spectrum area: a <b><font
color="#ff0000">red</font></b> one and a <b><font
color="#0000ff">blue</font></b> one.<p>

The <b><font color="#0000ff">blue</font></b> cursor line is displayed at the
mouse pointer position when the last is located inside the graphic area. It
can be used to determine which frequency corresponds to a given point of the
spectrum. The frequency value is displayed above the cursor line, in the
upper part of the display.<p>

The <b><font color="#ff0000">red</font></b> cursor shows the current
tuning frequency of the receiver. The shaded area at both sides
of this cursor represents the current receiver bandwidth, according to
the selected <a href="controls.html#filters">filter</a>.<p>

You can click on any point of the spectrum to reposition the <b><font
color="#ff0000">red</font></b> cursor, and to consequently tune the receiver
to that frequency. You can also drag the red cursor around to listen to the
different stations on the band.<p>

<a name="close"></a>
<b>Closing the window</b><p>

Use the <b>Close</b> button to close the scan window. Any scan in progress
will be stopped and the receiver returned to normal operation.<p>
