<H1>Using Frequency Database Files</H1>

Frequency databases provides the user with an easy way to store and recall
favorite station information and frequencies.<p>

<b>Opening a new database window</b><p>

To open a new Frequency Database window, select "Frequency Database" from
the <a href="controls.html#menu">application menu</a>. You can have any
number of database windows open simultaneously.<p>

<b>Loading an existing database</b><p>

Use the "Open" option from the "File" menu of the Frequency Database window
to load a database. Currently supported formats are Clifton Turner's *.320
and Ten-Tec's exported *.cdf files.<p>

<b>Creating a new database</b><p>

Just <a href="#open">open</a> a new Frequency Database window and start
entering stations.<p>

<b>Adding stations</b><p>

To enter a new station into the database, select "Add new station" from the
Edit menu, or click on the "New" toolbar icon. Then type the station
information in the dialog that appears:<p>

Note that some of the dialog fields have been already filled for you with
the current receiver settings, like the tuning frequency, detection mode and
filter. That makes storing new stations you just found easier: all you have
to do is to enter a name for it. You can modify these fields or leave them
unmodified as you wish. You can always edit them later.<p>

<b>Tuning to a station</b><p>

To tune the receiver to a station from the database, just double-click its
name. Alternatively, you can highlight it with a single click, then either use
the "Tune to station" option from the Edit menu, or click on the "Tune"
toolbar icon.<p>

<b>Editing station information</b><p>

Highlight the station you want to modify, then select "Change entry" from
the Edit menu. A dialog similar to the "Add new station" will appear,
allowing you to edit the station information.<p>

<b>Deleting stations</b><p>

Highlight the stations you want to delete, then either select "Delete
selected station(s)" from the Edit menu, or click on the "Delete" toolbar
icon.<p>

You can select a group of adjacent entries by clicking and dragging the
mouse in a lasso-like fashion. You can add or remove entries from the
selection by holding the &lt;Ctrl> key down when clicking on the entries.<p>

<b>Sorting entries</b><p>

To sort a given column of the frequency database table, click on its header.
The first click sorts the column in ascending order. Clicking again sorts
the column in descending order, and so on.<p>

You can also sort the table by two or more columns: just click on the
desired columns in turn. For example, suppose you want to sort the stations
by name in ascending order, and stations with the same name by ascending
tuning frequency: all you have to do is to click on the "Frequency" column
header first, then on the "Station name" header.<p>

If you want the table to be sorted the next time you load it, save it
immediately after sorting.<p>
