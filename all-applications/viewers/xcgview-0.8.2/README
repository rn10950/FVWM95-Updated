This is the version 0.8.2 of xcgview, a xclass port of ghostview 1.5

Status Of The Port  or  Currently Implemented Features:

- It can read a file using the File/Open dialog box.

- It can also print the whole document or a range of pages. To select a
  range of pages, just drag the mouse pointer over the page index listbox,
  then select "Page/Mark" from the menu. Ctrl/click and Shift/click can
  also be used. The behaviour should be similar to Windows-95 multiple-
  selection listboxes.

- Selected pages can be saved to a PS file.

- Page size and orientation is now correct for EPS files. The default
  value can be changed with the "View/Orientation" menu.

- If the file contains information about page numbers (as it should be),
  a "Page Index" listbox is displayed and can be used to go to specific
  page numbers. Also, you can navigate through the document by using
  the toolbar buttons "Next Page" and "Previous Page", and/or the
  PgUp/PgDn keys.

- If the file does not contain information about page numbers, then only
  the "Next Page" option can be used. If the end of the document is reached,
  it will wrap around to the beginning.

- It supports zooming and unzooming of the whole page, but not of
  a region of the document.

- The page media menu is dynamically constructed. It consists of two parts:
  the document defined page medias and the standard page media from Adobe's
  PDD. When a document is first opened, the program will use the page
  sizes defined in the document (if any). But once the user selects a
  different media, it will override any document settings for all pages.

- Ghostscript output and error messages are automatically displayed.

- The filename can be specified in the command line, so now you can have
  the following in your ~/.xclass/etc/mime.types file:

    [application/postscript]
    description = Postscript files
    pattern = *.e?ps
    icon = ps.xpm
    action = xcgview %s


This version of xcgview requires xclass 0.7.3 or later. In order to compile
the program, cd to the directory where you unpacked the sources and type
'make'. Copy the resulting 'xcgview' executable to a directory in your
$PATH (or use 'make install' as superuser).

Have fun,
Hector.
