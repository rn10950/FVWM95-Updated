The following libraries are required on newer versions of Debian:
libext-dev
libxpm-dev
libxt-dev
libx11-dev
libxmu-headers
libxmu-dev

The following bootstrap would work (from a root terminal or prefixed with sudo):
    apt-get install libxext-dev libxpm-dev libxt-dev libx11-dev libxmu-headers libxmu-dev

This is fvwm-2.0.43 hacked for a look and feel similar to Windows-95.

The installation process is more or less the same as for the standard
fvwm2, the only difference is that the program name will be fvwm95, and
the modules will be copied to /usr/local/lib/X11/fvwm95 by default. 
Refer to the file INSTALL for more details. 

I also have included a hacked version of the Win95WinList module from
David Barth (original from Mike Finger), whichs looks very close to the
Windows-95 task bar. There is a clock and incoming mail indicator on it,
it can also swallow other modules. The module is named FvwmTaskBar, for
more information read the README file in the modules/FvwmTaskBar
directory.

For best results, use the supplied system.fvwm95rc as your initial
.fvwm95rc file, and customize it as necessary. I have tried to use the
same colors as in Windows-95, as well as similar-looking fonts for the
title bar and menus. Basically, the format used in the file is the same as
in the standard .fvwm2rc, with some minor differences and additional
commands, they are briefly explained in the example file. 

I have included in the directory mini-icons some 16x16 pixmaps that can be
used for the menus (the example.fvwm95rc uses some of them). All they
together use no more than 8 colors, and they look best over a light gray
background (such as the #c0c0c0 used in the example configuration).
